        <h2>Computer Upgrades and Optimisation</h2>
        <p>
            Upgrading your computer by increasing its RAM will enable you to run more applications, whilst replacing your hard drive with a solid-state drive (SSD) will result in faster start-up times and quicker access to your data. Upgrading your Graphics Card will also provide a huge FPS boost in games. Often upgrading one or both components will yield performance results which means your old computer can be brought up to date and handle latest games, applications and needs of the user. We can provide you with any upgrade you need and trade in your old for new. Alternatively, we also offer optimisation services, where we can speed up and optimise your system to run efficiently and get the max out of it.
